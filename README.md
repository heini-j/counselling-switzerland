#Counselling in Switzerland

This repository contains a data mining project on the availability of counselling in Switzerland. The project was carried out as part of the course "Data Mining with R" in University of Luzern.

The whole project is described and explained in the file "Project report". The contents of the repository are as follows:

01 scraping process: The preparations for the scraping using RSelenium and the actual scraping from the website.

02 analysis: two scripts for analysis on the scraped data and the script for the visualisations.

03 visualisations: five visualisations from the project, four of which are maps.

04 data: the scraped dataset in csv format, including the zipcode, languages, target groups, billing and availability information.
